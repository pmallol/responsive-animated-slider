#### Using React, animations and React Hooks!

A colaborative proyect made by [@pyritewolf](https://github.com/pyritewolf), [@bcardiff](https://github.com/bcardiff/), [@danimibas](https://github.com/danimibas) and myself.

### Technical overview

The slider was build using the following technologies:

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/): a library to build the UI.
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html): it that allows you to use state and lifeCycle React features in a functional component.
- [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/): a library used to implement basic animations.
- [react-use-gesture](https://github.com/react-spring/react-use-gesture): another library used to bind mouse or touch events.
